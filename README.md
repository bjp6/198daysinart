198 cards on a wall drivven by rasberry pi pico

Ruth created a large number of drawing, paintings, prints on cards in the same format over the course of a year
I got this cards as gifts, remainders, messages in boxes, suitcases and little books.
to make this beautiful art visible we decided to find a creative way to present them.
We made the formats identical by gluing them on standard C5 cards, linking them together woth Stabilit Natur Bindfaden 1,3 mm
There are 2 sides to each thread, 11 cards in a row - 22 cards on one double thread
There are 9 threads which in total hold 198 cards

We made a board with holes, 3d printed holders and screwed the threads in place with an actuator on top.

That actuator will be driven by a servo motor for each tread controlled by a PCA9685 servo driver and a Rasberry Pi Pico microcontroller
